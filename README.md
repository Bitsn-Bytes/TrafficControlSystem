# Intelligent Traffic Control System
Abstract: Currently, traffic congestion is one of the most serious issues that most cities are facing. In order to improve the urban traffic orders, as well as to alleviate traffic pressures, we present an AI-based intelligent traffic control system, which is based on real-time traffic feed. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based architecture to dynamically adjust traffic signals duration using a Deep Q network. Compared to existing approaches that focus on traffic signal optimization for a single intersection our approach is based on a collaborative control of traffic signal phases of multiple intersections. The traffic signals duration time could finally be intelligently adjusted according to the real-time road traffic flow information thereby improving in control for traffic and also reducing cumulative wait time of vehicles.
